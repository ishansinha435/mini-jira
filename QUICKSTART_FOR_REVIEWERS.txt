## Test Data

Feel free to create as much test data as you want:
- Your data is **completely isolated** (other reviewers can't see it)
- Backend uses Row-Level Security (RLS) to ensure privacy
- All features are fully functional with the shared Supabase backend

Suggested test flow:
1. Create 2-3 projects (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Research")
2. Add 5-10 tasks across projects
3. Change some task statuses to "Done"
4. Add comments to tasks
5. Upload test files
6. Check the activity feed updates

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **UI:** shadcn/ui components
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth, PostgreSQL, Row-Level Security, Storage)
- **Deployment:** Docker-ready with multi-stage build

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
- Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- Look for the Docker whale icon in your system tray/menu bar
- It should be steady (not animating)

### "Port 3000 already in use"
- Another application is using port 3000
- Stop other dev servers or apps
- Or change the port in docker-compose.yml to 3001

### "Module not found" errors (Local option)
- Delete node_modules folder
- Run `npm install` again

### Login/Signup not working
- Check that .env.local file is in the correct location (root folder)
- Verify .env.local has two lines: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

### Features not working (comments/attachments/activity)
- These should work out of the box
- Database migrations are already applied
- If issues persist, contact the developer

---

## Database & Privacy

- **Backend:** Uses a shared Supabase PostgreSQL database
- **Security:** Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures complete data isolation
- **Your data:** Only visible to your account (email you signed up with)
- **Other reviewers:** Cannot see your projects/tasks/comments

---

## Additional Documentation

For more detailed information, see:
- `README.md` - Full project documentation
- `ProjectDocs/contexts/projectContext.md` - Project specifications
- `ProjectDocs/migrations/` - Database schema and setup
- `ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/` - Implementation notes per milestone

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check terminal output for error messages
3. Verify .env.local is present and correct
4. Try the alternative setup method (Docker vs Local)

---

## Clean Up After Review

### Docker option:
```
docker-compose down
docker rmi mini_jira-app
```

### Local option:
```
# Just delete the folder - no cleanup needed
```

Your test account and data remain in the Supabase database (isolated and private).

Enjoy reviewing Mini JIRA! 🎉
